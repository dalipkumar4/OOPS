<span style="font-size: 28px;">💡 Introduction</span>

C++ is an Object-Oriented Programming language, which allows you to organize your code using classes and objects.

This repository provides practical examples of all major OOP concepts:

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

All code is written in easy-to-understand C++, suitable for beginners and intermediate learners.

<span style="font-size: 28px;">✨ Features</span>

✅ Beginner-friendly C++ OOP examples

✅ Demonstrates constructors, destructors, and access specifiers

✅ Shows encapsulation using getters and setters

✅ Includes inheritance and polymorphism examples

✅ Organized by topic for easy learning
