<span style="font-size:32px;">💡 Introduction</span>

C++ is an Object-Oriented Programming language that uses classes and objects to organize code.

This repository covers major OOP concepts with practical C++ examples:

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

All code is easy-to-understand, perfect for beginners and intermediate learners.

<span style="font-size:32px;">✨ Features</span>

✅ Beginner-friendly C++ OOP examples

✅ Demonstrates constructors and destructors

✅ Shows encapsulation using getters and setters

✅ Includes inheritance and polymorphism examples

✅ Organized by topic for easy learning

<span style="font-size:32px;">🧩 Concepts Covered</span>
Concept	Description	Example File
Classes & Objects	Basics of classes and objects	classes_objects.cpp

Encapsulation	Private members, getters, setters	encapsulation.cpp

Inheritance	Single, multiple, multilevel	inheritance.cpp

Polymorphism	Overloading & overriding	polymorphism.cpp
