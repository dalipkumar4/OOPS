💡 Introduction

C++ is an Object-Oriented Programming language, which allows you to organize your code using classes and objects.

This repository provides practical examples of all major OOP concepts:

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

All code is written in easy-to-understand C++, suitable for beginners and intermediate learners.

✨ Features

✅ Beginner-friendly C++ OOP examples

✅ Demonstrates constructors, destructors, and access specifiers

✅ Shows encapsulation using getters and setters

✅ Includes inheritance and polymorphism examples

✅ Organized by topic for easy learning

🧩 Concepts Covered
Concept	Description	Example File
Classes & Objects	Basics of creating classes and objects	classes_objects.cpp

Encapsulation	Private members, getters, setters	encapsulation.cpp

Inheritance	Single, multiple, multilevel	inheritance.cpp

Polymorphism	Function overloading & overriding	polymorphism.cpp

Abstraction	Abstract classes & pure virtual functions	abstraction.cpp

Constructors & Destructors	Initialize and clean up objects	constructor_destructor.cpp
